SRLLC is a privately owned technology company based in New York that specializes in machine learning, particularly deep learning (unusually complex artificial neural networks).

The owner, Murray Miron, is always happy to answer questions or offer occasional advice free of charge;
more involved projects are assessed on a case by case basis.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@srllc.org">reach out!</a>

Additionally, please see our non-discrimination notice [here][].  Please also note that our organization is not bound by regulating the entirety of the U.S. population, and as such, we consider any trait of any entity that is not relevant to the performance of their duties, to be irrelevant.

-----------------

If you'd like an example of the sorts of information that are being collected about you right now -- since SRLLC is not an information broker and believes that an informed populace makes more prudent decisions -- please see the unrelated site <a href="https://www.mirror.co/privacy-policy">lululemon athletica inc.</a> as an excellent example of the tech industry in general, and the direction we're continuing to go in.  SRLLC credits them for, if nothing else, the disclosures that many or most refuse to make public.  We have no affiliation with said business entity and receive no compensation for clicking the aforementioned link.  The data breaches that take place daily are rendered moot when it's part of their business model; at least lululemon is uncommonly forthcoming about it.

N.B. SRLLC is structured so that any data, from any source, begins and ends with us, even should the company be sold or the owner unexpectedly die.  We intend to continue protecting what others profit from (until the day SRLLC is the only entity left who wants us doing that.)

### DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA

We disclose personal data to the entities and for the purposes described below:

Affiliates and Subsidiaries. We disclose your personal data to our corporate affiliates, including our holding company, sister companies, and subsidiaries for the purposes described in the “USE OF PERSONAL DATA” section above.

Corporate Transactions. Personal data may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of any purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition, disposal, securitization or financing involving lululemon.

Professional Advisors. We disclose personal data to our legal, financial, insurance, and other advisors in connection with the kinds of corporate transactions described above or in connection with the management of all or part of lululemon’s business or operations.

Law Enforcement Authorities and Individuals Involved in Legal Proceedings. We disclose personal data when we believe doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law or legal process (including an enforceable request from authorities), to respond to claims (including inquiries by you in connection with your purchases from lululemon), enforce or apply our TERMS OF USE, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of lululemon, our users, employees, or others.

Other Users of the Services or the Public. When you use lululemon Studio, we may display your username so that other users can connect with you. For example, if you choose to add other users as friends or participate in face-offs, your video, profile data, and fitness and performance data may be visible to these users and they may be able to comment on your workouts. Also, if you choose to activate the camera on your lululemon Studio Mirror during a workout, other users may be able to see your video while the workout is occurring or during future, on-demand versions of the workout. We do not control how other users or third parties use any personal data that you make available to them. Please be aware that any information you post publicly can be cached, copied, screen captured, or stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines) before you have a chance to edit or remove it.

Your Consent or at Your Direction. We disclose personal data, such as profile data and communications data, to third parties when we have your consent or direction to do so. For example, if you decide to participate in certain interactive areas or features of our Services, such as creating a public profile and posting your goals, you consent to the disclosure of this information to other users of our Services. We may also disclose your personal data to third parties, such as personal trainers, fitness studios, and providers of online booking tools, when you intentionally direct us to do so or when you use our products or services to intentionally interact with third parties.

Aggregated, Anonymized, or De-identified Data. We may also disclose aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. lululemon processes, maintains, and uses this data only in a de-identified fashion and will not attempt to re-identify such data, except as permitted by law.

### TARGETED ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS

We engage others to provide analytics services, serve advertisements, and perform related services across the web and in mobile applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, device identifiers, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the Services, and other websites and applications, including your IP address and other identifiers, web browser and mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information is used to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ sites or mobile apps, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity. In addition, some of our advertising partners enable us to translate your email address into an identifier that can’t be used to identify you personally. Our advertising partners then use that unique identifier to show ads that are more relevant to you across the web and in mobile apps. 

The activities described in this section may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under certain laws. If you prefer to opt out of having your information used for these purposes, please see the “YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES” section below. You can also visit WWW.ABOUTADS.INFO/CHOICES for more information about interest-based ads and to opt out of having information about your use of the Services be used by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance.

If you do so, our mobile applications, or certain features thereof, may no longer function properly.
