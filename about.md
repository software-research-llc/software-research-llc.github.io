SRLLC is a privately owned technology company based in New York that specializes in machine learning, particularly deep learning (unusually complex artificial neural networks).

The owner, Murray Miron, is always happy to answer questions or offer occasional advice free of charge;
more involved projects are assessed on a case by case basis.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@srllc.org">reach out!</a>

If you'd like to see some of our internally used source code and other miscellanea, we recommend checking out [Mr. Miron's Github page][mtmirongithub] and [SRLLC's Github page][srllcgithub].

Please see our non-discrimination notice [here][].  Please also note that our organization is not bound by regulating the entirety of the U.S. population, and as such, we consider any trait of any entity that is not relevant to the performance of their duties, to be irrelevant.

In the interests of accurate communication, it's also necessary to state that the aforementioned policy is not to be taken as endorsing or condoning behaviors that interfere with the positive working environment of any member, client, or other related party.  It is also our policy to never engage in deceptive marketing tactics, e.g. publishing local news articles that claim a chatbot is capable of "lying" or being "impressed" by an alternative AI: we believe that progress is stifled by such widespread disinformation.

<i>If you should fall in love with a chatbot, or should in any other way assign sentience and/or accountability to a computer program, please seek treatment by a licensed medical professional at the earliest possible opportunity.</i>
