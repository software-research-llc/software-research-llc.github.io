SRLLC is a privately owned technology company based in New York that specializes in machine learning, particularly deep learning (unusually complex artificial neural networks).

The owner, Murray Miron, is always happy to answer questions or offer occasional advice free of charge;
more involved projects are assessed on a case by case basis.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@srllc.org">reach out!</a>

Please see our non-discrimination notice [here][].

Mr. Miron hesitantly admits to being fond of aphorisms (or epigrams, depending on interpretation); with <3 are offered the most recent and poignant ones that he's encountered <a href="/epigrams/">here,</a> and <a href="/aphorisms/">here.</a>
