# Noteworthy projects

- **United States: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence**  
  Designed a system for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
  Intelligence to perform machine verification of collected information (i.e.
  automated provenance checking).

- **United States: Office of the Director of National Intelligence**  
  Designed a system for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
  to perform automated evaluation of analytic products (intelligence community
  reports), which is currently performed manually by the ODNI AIS (Analytic
  Integrity and Standards) staff.

- **United States: Department of Homeland Security**  
  Implemented software for use with "millimeter wave" scanners, as
  used by the Department of Homeland Security; relies on several deep
  neural net architectures and the DHS hardware units to automate the
  process of scanning subjects (e.g. airport passengers).

- **United States: National Institute of Justice**  
  Developed improved statistical and machine learning algorithms to
  assist law enforcement in location based crime forecasting, which is
  a method used by law enforcement agencies around the world to allocate
  on-call law enforcement officers efficiently.

- **United States: Department of Health and Human Services**  
  Rewrote RAT-STATS, a software application used by the Department
  of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General’s Office
  of Audit Services division.  RAT-STATS was commissioned in the 1970s,
  and has served as the gold standard tool for their division ever since;
  they require scientific level accuracy in their statistical tools as
  they investigate healthcare fraud, and we were privileged to provide
  them with an update.

- **Confidential organization**  
  Developed a software system to provide automatic categorization of operational
  status codes, as sent by machines from power plants to unified monitoring
  centers.  The terms we agreed to prevent further disclosure.
