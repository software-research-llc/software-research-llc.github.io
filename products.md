<p>SRLLC has a program responding to SMS messages (mobile text messages). It's available free of charge at +1-315-757-4475; however, in order to ensure compliance with all possible foreign laws and regulations, responses will only be sent to the continental United States.</p>

<p><h3>Note: if you are not considered an adult in your geographic region, please consider <i>this request to not use our service as a minor</i> to be age-gating for regulatory purposes.</h3></p>


<u>Miscellanea:</u>
- We disclaim any liability for any actions taken based on the generated content, or taking generated content too seriously. Also, be aware that it may not always reflect our positions, practices, or beliefs.
- Uptime is not guaranteed, and it may go down for days at a time without warning. When the service is actively responding to incoming messages, they'll be generated and sent in less than 60 seconds. When it's down, any messages that were received while it's down will be responded to when it comes back up.
- We keep logs of the messages received, messages sent, and what number(s) messages came from or went to; any other records under our control pertaining to messages are deleted.
- While we do no filtering whatsoever based on message content, the mobile providers that we are registered with do. Be aware of it: it's beyond our control.
- Responses are limited to a maximum of 1600 characters (ten message segments).
- Sending nothing but a ? (a single character question mark) will offer some usage information.
