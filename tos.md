### Preface
SRLLC reserves the right to enforce these terms of use through legal action in any venue of our choice.  Additionally, we will not be considered to have waived any of these rights due to delayed enforcement, or non-enforcement, prior to the filing of an action.  SRLLC may occasionally change these terms at our discretion, and given that no personal information is retained by SRLLC, it is impossible for SRLLC to notify other parties of changes; thus it is your responsibility to review this agreement for any changes as appropriate.

All legal fees required to enforce these rights will be paid by the defendant, and will be independent of, and in addition to, any judgment awarded to SRLLC.

### Terms of viewing this website
By viewing this website and utilizing the information contained herein, whether: directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, deliberately or coincidentally, immediately or at any point in the future, you indemnify SRLLC against any and all damages or obligations resulting from the repercussions of your use of said knowledge.  In addition, you grant to SRLLC the right to audit any and all processes which contributed to your use of this knowledge, be they biochemical, electrical or mechanical in nature.  This auditing is to include independent contributions that may be only tangential in nature or even wholly unrelated to knowledge obtained from SRLLC.  This right will survive until explicitly waived by SRLLC in writing.

You will have 30 days to produce all applicable materials, including necessary persons, from SRLLC providing notice within writing that it has chosen to exercise its rights under this agreement.

By viewing any data on any page at SRLLC's domain, you have agreed to these terms unconditionally.  Should any portion be considered unenforceable in a given district for any reason whatever, the surviving portions shall remain fully enforceable.

### In closing
Once again, we have no records of who has viewed our information.
