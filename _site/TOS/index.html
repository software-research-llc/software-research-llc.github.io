				<h2>SRLLC's Brief Terms of Service</h2>
			
			
			<p>Please be advised that SRLLC follows a strict set of rules regarding privacy and data, both ours and yours.  If software is executing on our machines, as it is when a corporate web browser loads and renders a page sent to it by your servers, we consider it our property without restriction.  Naturally the code is yours, but if it behaves in unexpected or malicious ways, we consider that a breach of trust and pursue the severe instances.</p>

<p>As another example, if you install service workers in our company browsers without notification or permission, we may well sue you.  If you track our company’s business activities in any other way, or increase our electricity bills by utilizing our hardware to execute code we were not notified of, then again: we may well sue you.  If we’re particularly affronted by circumstances, we may go as far as reporting it as a criminal offense to a federal court.  The chances of a criminal action being opened and a DA prosecuting the offense are virtually nil, but we’ll still attempt it.</p>

<p>With all that said, please bear in mind that we’re not trying to disrupt your business; even if your business is intolerable, take the practices somewhere else and we won’t care about it.  In short, we exercise our right to manage our business and our property as we see fit, not as others see fit.  It’s something we feel very strongly about, I’m afraid, so please try and work around it.  If you can’t, then get lost.  Thank you and have a great day.</p>
