				<h2>SRLLC's Facetious Terms of Service</h2>
			
			
			<p>Please be advised that SRLLC follows a strict set of rules regarding privacy and data, both ours and yours.  If software is executing on our machines, as it is when a corporate web browser loads and renders a page sent to it by your servers, we consider it our property without restriction.  Naturally the code is yours, but if it behaves in unexpected or malicious ways, we consider that a breach of trust and pursue the severe instances on the grounds that our hardware was utilized under fraudulent pretenses.</p>

<p>As another example, if you install service workers (that do shady stuff) in our company browsers without notification or permission, we may well sue you.  If you track our company’s business activities in any other way, or increase our electricity bills by utilizing our hardware to execute code we were not notified of, then again: we may well sue you.  If we’re particularly affronted by circumstances, we may go as far as reporting it as a criminal offense to a federal court.  The chances of a criminal action being opened and a DA prosecuting the offense are virtually nil, but we’ll still attempt it.</p>

<p>With all that said, please bear in mind that we’re not trying to disrupt your business; even if your business practices are nigh intolerable, just leave us out of them and you won’t hear so much as a peep about it.  There are also a number of desirable benefits that come along with organizations like Facebook, Google, and so many other entities who track users across all domains, as opposed to only their own (i.e. tracking all visits to all sites, as opposed to only visits to the company’s site).  What we object to is the lack of transparency, the lack of prior approval, the lack of effective administrative remedies, and the presumed availability of data with respect to intentions of governments in the near and far future: personally I’d rather the next Supreme Leaders of North Korea didn’t have the entirety of my internet history at their disposal, and so forth.</p>

<p>In short, we exercise our right to manage our business and our property as we see fit, not as others see fit.  It’s something we feel very strongly about, I’m afraid, so please try and work around us if you can.  If you can’t, then get lost: you do not have our consent to use our data if you aren’t reasonable about it.  Our TOS is as binding as your TOS, albeit much less formal; products that are the direct result of our energy or efforts, e.g. browsing histories, captcha solutions, and/or whatever else crowdsourcing provides that you make use of, may only be used if you’re polite and cautious about how you use it.</p>

<p>N.B. we can afford to be informal, given that we don’t ship your personal data halfway ‘round the globe and back.</p>
