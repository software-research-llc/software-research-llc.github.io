				<h2>Department of Health and Human Services</h2>
                <h3>Statistical Software for Healthcare Oversight Challenge</h3>
                <p>"Each year HHS handles hundreds of millions of Medicare and Medicaid claims valued at over a trillion dollars. Due to the high volume of claims, statistical sampling provides a critical tool to ensure effective oversight of these expenditures. Sampling is used by the providers in their own efforts to monitor their performance and by the various organizations within HHS... The objective of the current challenge is to develop the foundation for an upgraded version of RAT-STATS. The current version of RAT-STATS is well validated; however, its user interface can be difficult to navigate and the underlying code makes the software costly to update. OIG needs a new, modern version of the software that is easy to use and can be extended in a cost effective manner. In addition, the new version of the software must be 508 compliant." - <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/statistical-software-for-healthcare-oversight/">Contest description</a>.
            <p><u>Outcome</u>: paid finalist.

				<h2>Department of Homeland Security</h2>
                <h3>DHS / TSA Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge</h3>
                <p>"As part of their Apex Screening at Speed Program, DHS has identified high false alarm rates as creating significant bottlenecks at the airport checkpoints. Whenever TSA’s sensors and algorithms predict a potential threat, TSA staff needs to engage in a secondary, manual screening process that slows everything down... Currently, TSA purchases updated algorithms exclusively from the manufacturers of the scanning equipment used. These algorithms are proprietary, expensive, and often released in long cycles. In this competition, TSA is stepping outside their established procurement process and is challenging the broader data science community to help improve the accuracy of their threat prediction algorithms. Using a dataset of images collected on the latest generation of scanners, participants are challenged to identify the presence of simulated threats under a variety of object types, clothing types, and body types." - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/passenger-screening-algorithm-challenge">Contest description</a>.
                           <p><u>Outcome</u>: top 9% of participants.

				<h2>National Institute of Justice</h2>
                <h3>Real Time Crime Forecasting Challenge</h3>
                <p>"The Real-Time Crime Forecasting Challenge sought to harness the advances in data science to address the challenges of crime and justice. It encouraged data scientists across all scientific disciplines to foster innovation in forecasting methods. The goal was to develop algorithms that advance place-based crime forecasting through the use of data from one police jurisdiction... Specifically, the Challenge tested how effectively and efficiently contestants’ crime forecasting algorithms could forecast police calls-for-service in four crime categories in Portland, Oregon, for five forecast periods." - <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/real-time-crime-forecasting-challenge">Contest description</a>.
            <p><u>Outcome</u>: we won.

                <h3>ODNI-OUSD(I) Xamine Challenge</h3>
                <p>"Machine-based approaches to generating and evaluating analytic products from disparate structured and unstructured data types are emerging areas of research for the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). As these approaches mature beyond demonstration systems with controlled data sources, such IC systems will require a means for inspecting and ensuring the integrity of the data that are ingested by these systems.  These considerations will become particularly critical as the information available to the IC’s analytic community continues to exceed the ability for traditional, human vetting.  Accordingly, the ODNI and OUSD(I) are seeking ideas and descriptions of a viable technical approach for enabling the automated validation of information prior to the dissemination of machine-generated intelligence products." - <a href="https://innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9934079">Contest description</a>.

                <p>"The evaluation of analytic products is an area ripe for exploring new technological capabilities and approaches.  Currently, intelligence products are reviewed—prior to publication—by numerous levels of management and edited against an Intelligence Community (IC) agency’s signature style using essentially the same methods as publishers have traditionally used. The ODNI and OUSD(I) are seeking ideas and descriptions of a viable technical approach for enabling the automated evaluation of finished intelligence products." - <a href="https://innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9934078">Contest description</a>.

                <p>"Every day, work-related injury records are generated. In order to alleviate the human effort expended with coding such records, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in close partnership with the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), is interested in improving their NLP/ML model to automatically read injury records and classify them according to the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS)." - <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30103825">Contest overview</a>.

                <h3>SpaceNet 5 Challenge</h3>
                <p>"Determining optimal routing paths in near real-time is at the heart of many humanitarian, civil, military, and commercial challenges... In a disaster response scenario, for example, pre-existing foundational maps are often rendered useless due to debris, flooding, or other obstructions. Satellite or aerial imagery often provides the first large-scale data in such scenarios, rendering such imagery attractive in the quest to aid disaster response. This public competition will challenge competitors to automatically extract road networks from satellite imagery, along with travel time estimates along all roadways, thereby permitting true optimal routing." - <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/announcing-spacenet-5-road-networks-and-optimized-routing-10ca8538cde9">CosmiQ Works blog</a>.
