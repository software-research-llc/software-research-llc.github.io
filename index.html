				<h2>Department of Health and Human Services</h2>
                <h3>Statistical Software for Healthcare Oversight Challenge</h3>
  <p>Rewrote RAT-STATS, a software application used by the Department
  of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General’s Office
  of Audit Services division.  RAT-STATS was commissioned in the late 1970s,
  and served as the gold standard tool for their division ever since.
            <p><u>Outcome</u>: paid finalist.

            <h2>European Food Safety Authority</h2>
            <h3>Natural Language Recognition Challenge</h3>
            <p>Implemented an end-to-end natural language processing package for the European Food Safety Authority in the domains of animal and plant research journals: machine learning models and software were developed to enhance the content information available during meta-analyses and systematic reviews.
            <p><u>Outcome</u>: We were one of the top 5 participants, however, no detailed rankings were provided.

                <h3>Text Classification Challenge</h3>
                <p>"Every day, work-related injury records are generated. In order to alleviate the human effort expended with coding such records, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in close partnership with the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), is interested in improving their NLP/ML model to automatically read injury records and classify them according to the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS)." - <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30103825">Contest overview [retrieved: 2019/11/01]</a>
                <p><u>Outcome</u>: still pending.

                <h2>CosmiQ Works, et. al.</h2>
                <h3>SpaceNet 5 Challenge</h3>
                <p>"Determining optimal routing paths in near real-time is at the heart of many humanitarian, civil, military, and commercial challenges... In a disaster response scenario, for example, pre-existing foundational maps are often rendered useless due to debris, flooding, or other obstructions. Satellite or aerial imagery often provides the first large-scale data in such scenarios, rendering such imagery attractive in the quest to aid disaster response. This public competition will challenge competitors to automatically extract road networks from satellite imagery, along with travel time estimates along all roadways, thereby permitting true optimal routing." - <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/announcing-spacenet-5-road-networks-and-optimized-routing-10ca8538cde9">CosmiQ Works blog [retrieved: 2019/11/01]</a>
                <p><u>Outcome</u>: 18th place (can't win 'em all)

				<h2>Department of Homeland Security</h2>
                <h3>DHS / TSA Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge</h3>
                <p>Implemented software for use with "millimeter wave" scanners, as
  used by the Department of Homeland Security; relies on several deep
  neural net architectures and the DHS hardware units to automate the
  process of scanning subjects (e.g. airport passengers).
            <p><u>Outcome</u>: top 9% of participants.
