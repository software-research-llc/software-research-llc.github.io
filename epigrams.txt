"A man has to feel that his life counts for something. That he has a purpose. If only to himself."

For it was not my ear that you whispered into but my heart;
it was not my lips that you kissed but my soul.

~Judy Garland~

One of the sexiest feelings is knowing something is going to happen next, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.

"All the forms of sexual perversion...have one thing in common: their roots reach down into the matrix of natural and normal sex life; there they are somehow closely connected with the feelings and expressions of our physiological erotism. They are...hyperbolic intensifications, distortions, monstrous fruits of certain partial and secondary expressions of this erotism which is considered 'normal' or at least within the limits of healthy sex feeling."
	--  Albert Eulenburg (1914)


The astonishing thing is not that some people steal or that others occasionally go out on strike, but rather that all those who are starving do not steal as a regular practice, and all those who are exploited are not continually out on strike: after centuries of exploitation, why do people still tolerate being humiliated and enslaved, to such a point, indeed, that they actually want humiliation and slavery not only for others but for themselves?"
	--  Spinoza (?)



Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come

"To refuse to inform yourself about the basic operation and maintenance of the equipment you depended on was to passively accept that tyranny and agree to its terms: when your equipment works, you’ll work, but when your equipment breaks down you’ll break down, too.

"The whole thinking process is still rather mysterious to us, but I
believe that the attempt to make a thinking machine will help us

    --  Alan Turing, 15 May 1951, “Can Digital Machines Think” BBC.


"Here’s the thing about people with good hearts. They give you excuses when you don’t explain yourself. They accept apologies you don’t give. They see the best in you when you don’t need them to. At your worst, they lift you up, even if it means putting their priorities aside. The word “busy” does not exist in their dictionary. They make time, even when you don’t. And you wonder why they’re the most sensitive people. You wonder why they’re the most caring people. You wonder why they are willing to give so much of themselves with no expectation in return. You wonder why their existence is not so essential to your well-being. It’s because they don’t make you work hard for the attention they give you. They accept the love they think they’ve earned and you accept the love you think you’re entitled to. Let me tell you something. Fear the day when a good heart gives up on you. Our skies don’t become gray out of no where. Our sunshine does not allow the darkness to take over for no reason. A heart does not turn cold unless it’s been treated with coldness for a while."
    -- Najwa Zabian

My band career ended late in my senior year when John Cooper and I
threw my amplifier out the dormitory window.  We did not act in haste.
First we checked to make sure the amplifier would fit through the
frame, using the belt from my bathrobe to measure, then we picked up
the amplifier and backed up to my bedroom door.  Then we rushed
forward, shouting "The WHO!  The WHO!" and we launched my amplifier
perfectly, as though we had been doing it all our lives, clean through
the window and down onto the sidewalk, where a small but appreciative
crowd had gathered.  I would like to be able to say that this was a
symbolic act, an effort on my part to break cleanly away from one state
in my life and move on to another, but the truth is, Cooper and I
really just wanted to find out what it would sound like.  It sounded
OK.

Much to his Mum and Dad's dismay, Horace ate himself one day.
He didn't stop to say his grace, he just sat down and ate his face.
"We can't have this!" his Dad declared, "If that lad's ate, he should
	be shared."
But even as he spoke they saw Horace eating more and more:
First his legs and then his thighs, his arms, his nose, his hair, his eyes...
"Stop him someone!" Mother cried, "Those eyeballs would be better fried!"
But all too late, for they were gone, and he had started on his dong...
"Oh! foolish child!" the father mourns "You could have deep-fried that
	with prawns,
Some parsley and and some tartar sauce..."
But H. was on his second course: his liver and his lights and lung,
His ears, his neck, his chin, his tongue; "To think I raised him from the cot,
And now he's going to scoff the lot!"
His Mother cried: "What shall we do?  What's left won't even make a stew..."
And as she wept, her son was seen, to eat his head, his heart his spleen.
and there he lay: a boy no more, just a stomach on the floor...
None the less, since it *was* his, they ate it -- that's what haggis is.

You should tip the waiter $10, minus $2 if he tells you his name,
another $2 if he claims it will be His Pleasure to serve you and
another $2 for each "special" he describes involving confusing terms
such as "shallots," and $4 if the menu contains the word "fixin's."  In
many restaurants, this means the waiter will actually owe you money.
If you are traveling with a child  aged six months to three years, you
should leave an additional amount equal to twice the bill to compensate
for the fact that they will have to take the banquette out and burn it
because the cracks are wedged solid with gobbets made of partially
chewed former restaurant rolls saturated with baby spit.

"Draining with the rain, craving the cane, on my back.. Listen to the crack. My legs they shake, i'm beginning to break, crying with a smile.. self denial and mutilation feels like masturbation, it becomes my inspiration to survive, stay alive to feel what is and what isn't real. My thoughts disturb, but only those who cant understand what it feels to live under an open hand. Without It i couldn't, i wouldn't be able to feel.. to feel what is. and what isn't. REaL.
       ------------------------------------------------->
Tearing the hair from my head, my face, it's red.
Sheets soaked, drowning in my bed.
All the dissapointment replays in my mind,
like a knot...like a bind.
I just cant seem to find the rights to my soul,
or inner recession.
silently repeating confessions of my obsession.
The need for false compensation for the life i chose.
I loved him. inside and out..from his head to his toes.
I drank his sweat like i needed it to survive.. but now he's gone with not even a goodbye.
But I was here before him and before you and before them..
I was here trying to make it.. trying to fake it.
That silly little smile that cant hide the broken peices in my eyes... that smile that says clearly i'm not worth while.

i have this image in my head, of the knife under my bed..
slowly penetrating my arm..my neck..
i'm a wreck.
addicted to the sin in the crevices of my mind.
My discoveries my losses i cant leave behind...
Blood draining, my life fading.
what a loss..someone of no cost.
i begin to shake, its not so very fake.. anymore.
this life others seem to adore.
its just a chore you fucking shut down whore.
What is left of a life so ruined.
So destroyed by the ones stopping you.
The ones you think about every time you think of who'd you leave behind, to define who you were.
Its just a chore..
I dont want my death to be beautiful and clean.
i want to be chopped up in a machine.
i want to feel the pain of going completely insane.
Blades slowly stripping my skin.
everything that makes me pretty being stripped thin.
I want them all to see.
Everyone thats ever made me, me.
I want them to be locked in forced to stare at my despair.
strapped to a chair.
i'm tired of feeling the way i do.
I wish everyone would just get a fucking clue."

You do not have to be good.

You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.

... Another writer again agreed with all my generalities, but said that as an
inveterate skeptic I have closed my mind to the truth.  Most notably I have
ignored the evidence for an Earth that is six thousand years old.  Well, I
haven't ignored it; I considered the purported evidence and *then* rejected
it.  There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between 
prejudice and postjudice.  Prejudice is making a judgment before you have
looked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudice
is terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make serious
mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can't be perfect of course; you
may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you
have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

	A guy returns from a long trip to Europe, having left his beloved 
dog in his brother's care.  The minute he's cleared customs, he calls up his 
brother and inquires after his pet.
	"Your dog's dead," replies his brother bluntly.
	The guy is devastated.  "You know how much that dog meant to me," 
he moaned into the phone.  "Couldn't you at least have thought of a nicer way 
of breaking the news?  Couldn't you have said, `Well, you know, the dog got 
outside one day, and was crossing the street, and a car was speeding around a 
corner...' or something...?  Why are you always so thoughtless?"
	"Look, I'm sorry," said his brother, "I guess I just didn't think."
	"Okay, okay, let's just put it behind us.  How are you anyway?
How's Mom?"
	His brother is silent a moment.  "Uh," he stammers, "uh... Mom got 
outside one day..."

Once I belonged to a group that really had THE WORD.  I fought like hell
for them.  But another group came along and exposed the word of my group
as shallow and degenerate.  They had a better word.  So I quit the first
group and lost all the friends I had made and I joined up with this new
group.  I fought like hell for them.  But another group came around.  They
exposed the word of my group as false and materialistic.  Their word was
very much better.  So I quit the second group and lost all the friends I
had made.  And I joined up with this new group.  I fought like hell for them.
Till this one guy came along and proved that there wasn't any word at all.
That I should go off as an individual and grow!  So I quit the last group
and lost all the friends I had made.  And now I sit home alone all day and
all I do is grow.  It would be nice to join up with some others who feel
the way I do.

Theorem: All positive integers are equal.
Proof: Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.
	Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N > 0, if A and B
	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.

Proceed by induction:
	If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.
	So A = B.

Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B with
	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
	(A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.

Marvin Minsky is an actor in an artificial intelligence koan (attributed to his student, Danny Hillis) from the Jargon file:

        In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6 (computer).
		  "What are you doing?" asked Minsky.
        "I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-tac-toe," Sussman replied.
        "Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.
        "I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play," Sussman said.
        Minsky then shut his eyes.
        "Why do you close your eyes?" Sussman asked his teacher.
        "So that the room will be empty."
        At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.

    What I actually said was, "If you wire it randomly, it will still have preconceptions of how to play. But you just won't know what those preconceptions are."

... But if we laugh with derision, we will never understand.  Human
intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as
we can tell.  If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues
that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding
of their world, not in their distorted perceptions.  Even the standard
example of ancient nonsense -- the debate about angels on pinheads --
makes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing
whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a

a dream of a machine, with springs and gears and perfect in every
respect. And they lived with it, and on it, and under it, and inside

then they put them all together, and if one didn't fit, why they
chipped at it a bit, and everything was just fine...

I am always amazed when people say that. I always want to respond by asking why they need cuffs? Why not just say "stay still?" Why use a paddle? Just tell them they have been bad. Why use a gag when saying "Be quiet" will work just as well. Why humiliate someone when you can just give them the command "Feel ashamed."

Those examples are no less ridiculous than telling someone into chastity that they shouldn't need a device.

I have good looking kids. Thank goodness my wife cheats on me.

I told my wife the truth. I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist.
Then she told me the truth: that she was seeing a psychiatrist, two
plumbers, and a bartender.

My marriage is on the rocks again, yeah, my wife just broke up with
her boyfriend.

My wife is always trying to get rid of me. The other day she told me
to put the garbage out. I said to her I already did. She told me to
go and keep an eye on it.

My wife met me at the door the other night in a sexy negligee.
Unfortunately, she was just coming home.

My wife wants sex in the back of the car and she wants me to drive.

My wife was afraid of the dark... then she saw me naked and now she's
afraid of the light.

We sleep in separate rooms, we have dinner apart, we take separate
vacations - we're doing everything we can to keep our marriage
together.

What a kid I got, I told him about the birds and the bee and he told
me about the butcher and my wife.

With me, nothing goes right. My psychiatrist said my wife and I
should have sex every night. Now, we'll never see each other!

With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday
to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.

My wife told me she was sick of me, that she would only let me have
sex once a month. Hey, that ain't bad, I know two guys she cut off

Why, when no honest man will deny in private that every ultimate problem is
wrapped in the profoundest mystery, do honest men proclaim in pulpits that
unhesitating certainty is the duty of the most foolish and ignorant?  Is it
not a spectacle to make the angels laugh?  We are a company of ignorant
beings, feeling our way through mists and darkness, learning only be
incessantly repeated blunders, obtaining a glimmering of truth by falling
into every conceivable error, dimly discerning light enough for our daily
needs, but hopelessly differing whenever we attempt to describe the ultimate
origin or end of our paths; and yet, when one of us ventures to declare that
we don't know the map of the universe as well as the map of our infintesimal
parish, he is hooted, reviled, and perhaps told that he will be damned to all
eternity for his faithlessness.

The most unsatisfactory men are those who pride themselves on their
virility and regard sex as if it were some form of athletics at which
you win cups. It is a woman's spirit and mood which a man has to

man who can thrill you by just touching your head or smiling into
your eyes - or just by staring into space.

Theorem: All positive integers are equal.
Proof: Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.
	Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N > 0, if A and B
	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.

Proceed by induction:
	If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.
	So A = B.

Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B with
	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
	(A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.




	There was a mad scientist (a mad... social... scientist) who kidnapped
three colleagues, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician, and locked

cell and found it long empty.  The engineer had constructed a can opener from
pocket trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to make an explosive,

	The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids
off the tin cans by throwing them against the wall.  She was developing a good

The annual meeting of the "You Have To Listen To Experience" Club is now in
session.  Our Achievement Awards this year are in the fields of publishing,
advertising and industry.  For best consistent contribution in the field of
publishing our award goes to editor, R.L.K., [...] for his unrivalled alle-
giance without variation to the statement: "Personally I'd love to do it,
we'd ALL love to do it.  But we're not going to do it.  It's not the kind of
book our house knows how to handle."  Our superior performance award in the
field of advertising goes to media executive, E.L.M., [...] for the continu-
ally creative use of the old favorite: "I think what you've got here could be
very exciting.  Why not give it one more try based on the approach I've out-
lined and see if you can come up with something fresh."  Our final award for
courageous holding action in the field of industry goes to supervisor, R.S.,
[...] for her unyielding grip on "I don't care if they fire me, I've been
arguing for a new approach for YEARS but are we SURE that this is the right
time--"  I would like to conclude this meeting with a verse written specially
for our prospectus by our founding president fifty years ago -- and now, as
then, fully expressive of the emotion most close to all our hearts --
	Treat freshness as a youthful quirk,
		And dare not stray to ideas new,
	For if t'were tried they might e'en work
		And for a living what woulds't we do?

If I had my life to live over, I'd try to make more mistakes next time.  I
would relax, I would limber up, I would be sillier than I have been this
trip.  I know of very few things I would take seriously.  I would be crazier.
I would climb more mountains, swim more rivers and watch more sunsets.  I'd
travel and see.  I would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary ones.
You see, I am one of those people who lives prophylactically and sensibly
and sanely, hour after hour, day after day.  Oh, I have had my moments and,
if I had it to do over again, I'd have more of them.  In fact, I'd try to
have nothing else.  Just moments, one after another, instead of living so many
years ahead each day.  I have been one of those people who never go anywhere
without a thermometer, a hotwater bottle, a gargle, a raincoat and a parachute.
If I had it to do over again, I would go places and do things and travel
lighter than I have.  If I had my life to live over, I would start bare-footed
earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall.  I would play hooky
more.  I probably wouldn't make such good grades, but I'd learn more.  I would
ride on more merry-go-rounds.  I'd pick more daisies.

The others went home.			As year followed year.

Deserted, alone.			"Is that guy still here?"

Night passed into morning.		He died at the console
The room was cluttered			Of hunger and thirst
With core dumps, source listings.	Next day he was buried
"I'm close," he muttered.		Face down, nine edge first.

Chain smoking, cold coffee,		And his wife through her tears
Logic, deduction.			Accepted his fate.

"Just change one instruction."		He's just working late."

It was pleasant to me to get a letter from you the other day.  Perhaps
I should have found it pleasanter if I had been able to decipher it.  I
don't think that I mastered anything beyond the date (which I knew) and
the signature (which I guessed at).  There's a singular and a perpetual
charm in a letter of yours; it never grows old, it never loses its
novelty.  Other letters are read and thrown away and forgotten, but
yours are kept forever -- unread.  One of them will last a reasonable

At times I catch glimpses of memories I long ago shelved, and at once I am struck with what I have allowed maturity and objectivity to rob me of.  I once wandered in desperation, for I lacked the vision to see a path before me; I once thought I would break and crumble beneath the weight of my despair, for I knew not that enough tomorrows can leave behind only a tender scar where once was a seemingly mortal wound; I once felt such loneliness as to be certain that my lungs would collapse in on themselves with each breath I took, for I knew only isolation and crushing solitude; and once, through it all, I had within me a fire so brilliant and wild it threatened to consume me, for I had not yet loosened my grip on passion in order to reach for the temperance offered by age.  It is a tragedy of the Human condition that mastering oneself requires the dulling of intensity and the narrowing of emotion.

knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, and who spends himself in a
worthy cause, and if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that
he'll never be with those cold and timid souls who never know either victory

However, I prefer to take the opposite view--that what we call sensations are complex reflective activities. They sometimes involve extensive cascades in which some parts of the brain are affected by signals whose origins we cannot detect--and therefore, we find them hard to explain. So, I see no exceptional mystery here: we simply don't yet know enough about what is actually happening in our brains. But when you think enough about anything, then you see this is also the case with everything.

This legend, the truth of which is not necessarily related to its value,
concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of 
Copenhagen: "Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with 
a barometer."

One student replied: "Tie a long piece of string to the neck of the
barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the
ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal
the height of the building."

This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was
failed immediately.  He appealed on the grounds that his answer was 
indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter 
to decide the case. The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, 
but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics.

To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him
six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a
minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.  For five minutes 
the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter 
reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he
had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which
to use.  On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:
"Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop
it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The
height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t
squared. But bad luck on the barometer.

"Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then
set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the
length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of
proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.

"But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short
piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at
ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked
out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sq
root(l / g).

"Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier
to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths,
then add them up.

"If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you
could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the
skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars
into feet to give the height of the building.

"But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind
and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on
the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I
will give you this one if you tell me the height of this building'."

	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #8: LAIDBACK

This language was developed at the Marin County Center for T'ai Chi,
Mellowness and Computer Programming (now defunct), as an alternative to
the more intense atmosphere in nearby Silicon Valley.

The center was ideal for programmers who liked to soak in hot tubs
while they worked.  Unfortunately few programmers could survive there
because the center outlawed Pizza and Coca-Cola in favor of Tofu and
Perrier.

Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a gentle
and non-threatening language since all error messages are in lower
case.  For example, LAIDBACK responded to syntax errors with the
message:
	"i hate to bother you, but i just can't relate to that.  can
	you find the time to try it again?"

After this was written there appeared a remarkable posthumous memoir that
throws some doubt on Millikan's leading role in these experiments.  Harvey
Fletcher (1884-1981), who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago,
at Millikan's suggestion worked on the measurement of electronic charge for
his doctoral thesis, and co-authored some of the early papers on this subject
with Millikan.  Fletcher left a manuscript with a friend with instructions
that it be published after his death; the manuscript was published in
Physics Today, June 1982, page 43.  In it, Fletcher claims that he was the
first to do the experiment with oil drops, was the first to measure charges on
single droplets, and may have been the first to suggest the use of oil.
According to Fletcher, he had expected to be co-authored with Millikan on
the crucial first article announcing the measurement of the electronic
charge, but was talked out of this by Millikan.

Robert Millikan is generally credited with making the first really

A professor and his graduate student went on an Arctic expedition. During a trek over the ice, they looked behind them and saw, off in the distance, a polar bear pursuing them at breakneck speed. They started running as fast as they could. Soon the graduate student stopped, unzipped his backpack, and started putting on his jogging shoes. The professor looked back towards him and began shouting, "You idiot! You know there's nothing we can do to escape that bear. He's coming after us with tremendous speed!" The graduate student smiled and replied, "Professor, that's not the real problem. There's only one bear. The real problem is who can run faster - you, or I."

"To me Domination is the ability to create a hunger in someone that is so strong, they will do anything, anytime, anywhere, just to please You; a true submissive heart will answer a Dominant's calling when the need inside her is so strong.

Respect the woman, desire the slut, and cherish the little girl. Then You have the mind, the body, and the soul.

A submissive will kneel before her Master/Mistress with pride, so please, do not look upon her with pity; for if asked, she will tell You: this is exactly where she wishes to be."

You had, by the way, overestimated the meaningfulness of my
observations again: I was not aware that they had the meaning
that an energy tensor for gravitation was dispensable. If I
understand it correctly, my inadvertent statement now implies
that planetary motion would satisfy conservation laws just by
chance, as it were. What is certain is that I was not aware of
this consequence of my comments and cannot grasp the argument
even now.

The second law of thermodynamics holds, I think, the supreme 
position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you 
that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with 
Maxwell's equations - then so much the worse for Maxwell's
equations. If it is found to be contradicted by observation, 
well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But 
if your theory is found to be against the second law of 
thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for 
it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.

I do not see, Sir, that it is reasonable for a man to be angry at

"Strenuous intellectual work and looking at God's Nature are the reconciling, fortifying, yet relentlessly strict angels that shall lead me through all of life's troubles... And yet what a peculiar way this is to weather the storms of life -- in many a lucid moment I appear to myself as an ostrich who buries his head in the desert sand so as not to perceive the danger.  One creates a small little world for oneself, and as lamentably insignificant as it may be in comparison with the perpetually changing size of real existence, one feels miraculously great and important."

During almost fifteen centuries the legal establishment of Christianity has

Frobnicate, v.:
	To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ.
Usually abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to frob a
frob".  See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK
sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless
manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse
search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because
turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.

It is only a something that remains when I have eliminated everything belonging to the senses... but this something I know no further... There must here be a total absence of motive - unless this idea of an intelligible world is itself the motive... but to make this intelligible is precisely the problem that we cannot solve."

A wizard cannot do everything; a fact most magicians are reticent to admit,

... and no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion
as it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the
naive.  As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we
might be advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do
us the same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their
protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the most
virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians are
frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure of Jesus
because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.  Such ambiguity
is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every recognized Bible scholar
is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas, resort to formal lying to
obscure such reality.

 A manager went to his programmers and told them: ``As regards to your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave at five in the afternoon.'' At this, all of them became angry and several resigned on the spot.

Meantime, in the slums below Ronnie's Ranch, Cynthia feels as if some one
has made voodoo boxen of her and her favorite backplanes. On this fine
moonlit night, some horrible persona has been jabbing away at, dragging
magnets over, and surging these voodoo boxen.  Fortunately, they seem to

	A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him
invented a new program that became popular and sold well.  As a result, the
manager retained his job.
	The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer
refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I though it was an interesting
concept, and thus I expect no reward."
	The manager, upon hearing this, remarked, "This programmer, though he
holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an
employee.  Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"
	But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist
so that I can program.  If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste
everyone's time.  Can I go now?  I have a program that I'm working on."

Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #3

The proper time for a vicious ad hominem attack is when you have no logical
recourse.  If you have been arguing a point with a person or persons for
30 odd weeks, and an memo comes across that logically tears down the
final shred of evidence that you thought you had, that is the time to call
the author of that memo:
        1: a mindless twit who attacks other people's beliefs for no reason.
        2: an egotistical flaming typical wombat aggie melon-humping
           cheese-whizzing nanosexual subuseless clamsucker whose memos
           are apparently sneezed onto his/her terminal.
        3: something unpleasant.
The OTHER proper time for an ad hominem attack is immediately after someone
has posted something you don't understand.  Given the current state of modern
electronic communications technology your inability to comprehend the meaning
of an memo constitutes a violation of western moral tradition on the part of
the author of that memo, and the author should be taken to task publicly via
a series of really nasty, name-calling oriented memos.

"It is unfortunate that the media has twisted the term `hacker' into a criminal sort of vandalism.  Calling someone a hacker was once a compliment; a tipping-of-the-hat, so to speak, from one colleague to another.

Hence the obscure but clever phrase, `hack to learn, don't learn to hack.'"

An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an
anecdote, indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have no doubt
already heard.  After some observations and rough calculations the
engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing.  A few minutes later
the physicist understands too and chuckles to himself happily as he now
has enough experimental evidence to publish a paper.  This leaves the
mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed right away that he
was the subject of an anecdote, and deduced quite rapidly the presence of
humour from similar anecdotes, but considers this anecdote to be too
trivial a corollary to be significant, let alone funny.

                Safety Tips for the Post-Nuclear Existence
1.      Never use an elevator in a building that has been hit by a
                nuclear bomb, use the stairs.
2.      When you're flying through the air, remember to roll
                when you hit the ground.
3.      If you're on fire, avoid gasoline and other flammable materials.
4.      Don't attempt communication with dead people; it will only lead
                to psychological problems.
5.      Food will be scarce, you will have to scavenge.   Learn to recognize
                foods that will be available after the bomb: mashed potatoes,
                shredded wheat, tossed salad, ground beef, etc.
6.      Put your hand over your mouth when you sneeze, internal organs
                will be scarce in the post-nuclear age.
7.      Try to be neat, fall only in designated piles.
8.      Drive carefully in "Heavy Fallout" areas, people could be
                staggering illegally.
9.      Nutritionally, hundred dollar bills are equal to one's, but more
                sanitary due to limited circulation.
10.     Accumulate mannequins now, spare parts will be in short
                supply on D-Day.

		A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day.  The master
noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.  "Excuse me",
he said, "may I examine it?"
        The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master.
"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,
and Hard", said the master.  "Yet every such device has another level of play,
where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the
human."
        "Pray, great master," implored the novice, "how does one find this
mysterious setting?"
        The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under foot.
And suddenly the novice was enlightened.

In the course of reading Hadamard's "The Psychology of Invention in the
Mathematical Field", I have come across evidence supporting a fact
which we coffee achievers have long appreciated:  no really creative,
intelligent thought is possible without a good cup of coffee.  On page
14, Hadamard is discussing Poincare's theory of fuchsian groups and
fuchsian functions, which he describes as "... one of his greatest
discoveries, the first which consecrated his glory ..."  Hadamard refers
to Poincare having had a "... sleepless night which initiated all that
memorable work ..." and gives the following, very revealing quote:

	"One evening, contrary to my custom, I drank black coffee and
	could not sleep.  Ideas rose in crowds;  I felt them collide
	until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making a stable

	Hack placidly amidst the noisy printers and remember what prizes there
may be in Science.  As fast as possible get a good terminal on a good system.
Enter your data clearly but always encrypt your results.  And listen to others,
even the dull and ignorant, for they may be your customers.  Avoid loud and
aggressive persons, for they are sales reps.
	If you compare your outputs with those of others, you may be surprised,
for always there will be greater and lesser numbers than you have crunched.
Keep others interested in your career, and try not to fumble; it can be a real
hassle and could change your fortunes in time.
	Exercise system control in your experiments, for the world is full of
bugs.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive
for linearity and everywhere papers are full of approximations.  Strive for
proportionality.  Especially, do not faint when it occurs.  Neither be cyclical
about results; for in the face of all data analysis it is sure to be noticed.
	Take with a grain of salt the anomalous data points.  Gracefully pass
them on to the youth at the next desk.  Nurture some mutual funds to shield
you in times of sudden layoffs.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings
-- the real bugs are enough to screw you badly.  Murphy's Law runs the
Universe -- and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt <Curl>B*n dS = 0.
	Therefore, grab for a piece of the pie, with whatever proposals you
can conceive of to try.  With all the crashed disks, skewed data, and broken
line printers, you can still have a beautiful secretary.  Be linear.  Strive
to stay employed.

	LAIDBACK was developed at the (now defunct) Marin County Center for

intense languages of nearby Silicon Valley.
	The Center was ideal for programmers who liked to soak in hot tubs
while they worked.  Unfortunately, few programmers could survive there long,
since the Center outlawed pizza and RC Cola in favor of bean curd and Perrier.

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed from available data.  Our authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49) times as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we receive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can compute the temperature of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute temperature of the earth (approx. 300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the temperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas. Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, or 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a lake.)  We have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

I went on to test the program in every way I could devise.  I strained it to
expose its weaknesses.  I ran it for high-mass stars and low-mass stars, for
stars born exceedingly hot and those born relatively cold.  I ran it assuming
the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be absent -- not because I wanted
to know the answer, but because I had developed an intuitive feel for the

The only happiness lies in reason; all the rest of the world is dismal.
The highest reason, however, I see in the work of the artist, and he may
experience it as such.  Happiness lies in the swiftness of feeling and
thinking: all the rest of the world is slow, gradual and stupid.  Whoever
could feel the course of a light ray would be very happy, for it is very
swift.  Thinking of oneself gives little happiness.  If, however, one feels
much happiness in this, it is because at bottom one is not thinking of
oneself but of one's ideal.  This is far, and only the swift shall reach
it and are delighted.

over the cliff -- I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're
going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.  That's all I'd do

How could they think women a recreation?
Or the repetition of bodies of steady interest?
Only the ignorant or the busy could.  That elm
of flesh must prove a luxury of primes;
be perilous and dear with rain of an alternate earth.
Which is not to damn the forested China of touching.
I am neither priestly nor tired, and the great knowledge
of breasts with their loud nipples congregates in me.
The sudden nakedness, the small ribs, the mouth.
Splendid.  Splendid.  Splendid.  Like Rome.  Like loins.
A glamour sufficient to our long marvelous dying.
I say sufficient and speak with earned privilege,
for my life has been eaten in that foliate city.
To ambergris.  But not for recreation.
I would not have lost so much for recreation.

Nor for love as the sweet pretend: the children's game
of deliberate ignorance of each to allow the dreaming.
Not for the impersonal belly nor the heart's drunkenness
have I come this far, stubborn, disasterous way.
But for relish of those archipelagoes of person.
To hold her in hand, closed as any sparrow,
and call and call forever till she turn from bird
to blowing woods.  From woods to jungle.  Persimmon.
To light.  From light to princess.  From princess to woman
in all her fresh particularity of difference.
Then oh, through the underwater time of night
indecent and still, to speak to her without habit.
This I have done with my life, and am content.
I wish I could tell you how it is in that dark,
standing in the huge singing and the alien world.

"It seems that no degree of effort is sufficient to tear my desperate gaze away from the vast sea of emptiness I fear I'm drowning in; precious moments of fleeting distraction appear to be the only respite I am to have.  Time after time my vision is drawn inexorably back to the haunting image of that suffocating despair that threatens to rob me of the very sight it will not allow to escape.  I have floated in this silent madness for so long a time that I feel it is not only a part of my being, but indeed a part of the very core of that intangible essence which can only be vaguely described as 'me.'  The fact of the matter, you see, is that I eventually found myself so alone within this liquid nightmare that I began to cling to it even as it stole the breath from my lungs.

To say it has become my companion is woefully inadequate.  It has become so tightly entwined with my spirit and so deeply buried in my soul that I'm not sure 'I' am even here at all any longer.  I would make still my own heart to be rid of this howling solace, and yet at the same time I wish to never part with its enthralling ache.  I suppose I have come to love the shards of glass so intensely that no matter how scarred I become, I need this broken reflection: it is the purest form of beauty I have ever known."

	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #13: SLOBOL

SLOBOL is best known for the speed, or lack of it, of its compiler.
Although many compilers allow you to take a coffee break while they
compile, SLOBOL compilers allow you to travel to Bolivia to pick the
coffee.  Forty-three programmers are known to have died of boredom
sitting at their terminals while waiting for a SLOBOL program to
compile.  Weary SLOBOL programmers often turn to a related (but
infinitely faster) language, COCAINE.

"I imagine that for months the matter never comes into your head, and you're able to persuade yourself that you've finished with it for good and all.  You rejoice in your freedom, and you feel that at last you can call your soul your own.  You seem to walk with your head among the stars.  And then, all of a sudden you can't stand it any more, and you notice that all the time your feet have been walking in the mud.  And you want to roll yourself in it.  And you find some woman, coarse and low and vulgar, some beastly creature in whom all the horror of sex is blatant, and you fall upon her like a wild animal.  You drink till you're blind with rage... I'll tell you what must seem strange, that when it's over you feel so extraordinarily pure.  You feel like a disembodied spirit, immaterial; and you seem to be able to touch beauty as though it were a palpable thing; and you feel an intimate communion with the breeze, and with the trees breaking into leaf, and with the iridescence of the river.  You feel like God."

If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to
get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.
See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving
the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting
that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The
college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious
and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to
rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective.
Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure
interest in knowledge.  The wise instructor accomplishes this by
opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for
himself.  The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for
boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.

Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents, meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."

A large spider in an old house built a beautiful web in which to catch flies.
Every time a fly landed on the web and was entangled in it the spider devoured
him, so that when another fly came along he would think the web was a safe and
quiet place in which to rest.  One day a fairly intelligent fly buzzed around
above the web so long without lighting that the spider appeared and said,
"Come on down."  But the fly was too clever for him and said, "I never light
where I don't see other flies and I don't see any other flies in your house."
So he flew away until he came to a place where there were a great many other
flies.  He was about to settle down among them when a bee buzzed up and said,
"Hold it, stupid, that's flypaper.  All those flies are trapped."  "Don't be
silly," said the fly, "they're dancing."  So he settled down and became stuck
to the flypaper with all the other flies.

1: Do I dare trust a person who actually considers alfalfa sprouts a food?
2: Was the author's sole motive in writing this book to get rich

3: Would a longer life be worthwhile if it had to be lived as prescribed...

THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10 -- SIMPLE

        SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming
Language Environment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College
for Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write
code with errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,
END and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make a
syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful, thus achieving
the results of programs written in other languages without the tedious,
frustrating process of testing and debugging.

Result is demagogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy.

        A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a
strings of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be retained
throughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much, neither needless
loops nor useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelming
rigidity.
        A program should follow the 'Law of Least Astonishment'.  What is this
law?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the
way that astonishes him least.
        A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The
program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward
appearances.
        If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite the
program.

Aquavit is also considered useful for medicinal purposes, an essential
ingredient in what I was once told is the Norwegian cure for the common
cold.  You get a bottle, a poster bed, and the brightest colored stocking
cap you can find.  You put the cap on the post at the foot of the bed,
then get into bed and drink aquavit until you can't see the cap.  I've
never tried this, but it sounds as though it should work.

THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18 -- C-

        This language was named for the grade received by its creator when
		  he submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is
		  best described as a "low-level" programming language.  In fact, the language
		  generally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to execute
		  a given task.  In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.

...we must be wary of granting too much power to natural selection
by viewing all basic capacities of our brain as direct adaptations.
I do not doubt that natural selection acted in building our oversized
brains -- and I am equally confidant that our brains became large as
an adaptation for definite roles (probably a complex set of interacting
functions).  But these assumptions do not lead to the notion, often
uncritically embraced by strict Darwinians, that all major capacities
of the brain must arise as direct products of natural selection.

	But he was determined.                      He died at the console,
	The others went home.                       Of hunger and thirst.
	He spread out the program,                  Next day he was buried,
	Deserted, alone.                            Face down, nine-edge first.

"It could be that Walter's horse has wings" does not imply that there is
any such animal as Walter's horse, only that there could be; but "Walter's
horse is a thing which could have wings" does imply Walter's horse's
existence.  But the conjunction "Walter's horse exists, and it could be
that Walter's horse has wings" still does not imply "Walter's horse is a
thing that could have wings", for perhaps it can only be that Walter's
horse has wings by Walter having a different horse.  Nor does "Walter's
horse is a thing which could have wings" conversely imply "It could be that
Walter's horse has wings"; for it might be that Walter's horse could only
have wings by not being Walter's horse.

I would deny, though, that the formula [Necessarily if some x has property P

necessary that if someone is a better logician than I am then someone is a
better logician than I am" is false because there need not have been any me.

You will strengthen yourself in this way."

"Eggnog is a traditional holiday drink invented by the English.  Many
people wonder where the word "eggnog" comes from.  The first syllable
comes from the English word "egg", meaning "egg".  I don't know where
the "nog" comes from.

To make eggnog, you'll need rum, whiskey, wine gin and, if they are in
season, eggs..."

A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs,
documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him
one of the best programmers in the world. Why is this?"
        The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has
gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system
crashes, but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the
need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.
He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect
within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly,
he has entered the mystery of Tao."

"moralit['e].]
   1. The relation of conformity or nonconformity to the moral
      standard or rule; quality of an intention, a character, an
      action, a principle, or a sentiment, when tried by the
      standard of right.
      [1913 Webster]

 ...... If this is the definition of a good man, and if one possessed of a contrary - or indeed, opposed - disposition is an evil man...... perhaps I truly am of a warped comprehension - yet I do not believe so. Even if I am alone in my disregard for your ethical platitudes, I could not even in desire close my eyes from what I truly hold as Truth. To all who have termed me as unacceptable, as dangerous, as frightening and deserving of ostrocism -- know this: I am not sorry for my actions, not in the slightest. Moreover, I hold the majority of this festering farce of a culture undeserving of the peace their self-deluded ignorance affords them, and were I able to, I would with deep and satisfying pleasure rip their lies from them and leave them to crumble slowly under the burden of open-eyes. I grow bitter, and deeply desiring of absolution... but unlike you, I do not see any 'morality' holding be back. Is that revealing enough to get my point across, or shall I share some of the idle daydreams I have of burning you and your world into oblivion?  ... I have no further want of you, and so I have no hesitation in saying: you fooled yourselves again... you were more my victims, than you were ever my friends."

Fortune's Exercising Truths:

1:  Richard Simmons gets paid to exercise like a lunatic.  You don't.
2.  Aerobic exercises stimulate and speed up the heart.  So do heart attacks.
3.  Exercising around small children can scar them emotionally for life.
4.  Sweating like a pig and gasping for breath is not refreshing.
5.  No matter what anyone tells you, isometric exercises cannot be done
    quietly at your desk at work.  People will suspect manic tendencies as
    you twitter around in your chair.
6.  Next to burying bones, the thing a dog enjoys mosts is tripping joggers.
7.  Locking four people in a tiny, cement-walled room so they can run around
    for an hour smashing a little rubber ball -- and each other -- with a hard
    racket should immediately be recognized for what it is: a form of insanity.
8.  Fifty push-ups, followed by thirty sit-ups, followed by ten chin-ups,
    followed by one throw-up.
9.  Any activity that can't be done while smoking should be avoided.

        I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments
of others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, such
as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted instead of them "I conceive",
"I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it appears to me
at present".
        When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him
immediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by
observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,
but in the present case there appeared or seemed to me some difference, etc.
        I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the
conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I
proposed my opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.
I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.

        There once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as
he entered, the man told the guard at the door:
        "I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting.  Be
forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."
        This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions
of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully.
But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.
        When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,
but nothing was to be found.
        On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the
guard saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even
better."  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.
        On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his
curiosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live
in peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are stealing?"
        The man smiled.  "I am stealing ideas," he said.

"... hitherto we have been permitted to seek beauty only in the morally good - a fact which sufficiently accounts for our having found so little of it and having had to seek about for imaginary beauties without backbone! - As surely as the wicked enjoy a hundred kinds of happiness of which the virtuous have no inkling, so too they possess a hundred kinds of beauty; and many of them have not yet been discovered."

"[Where the good begins]  Where the poor power of the eye can no longer see the evil impulse as such because it has become too subtle, man posits the realm of goodness; and the feeling that we have now entered the realm of goodness excites all those impulses which had been threatened and limited by the evil impulses, like the feeling of security, of comfort, of benevolence. Hence, the duller the eye, the more extensive the good. Hence the eternal cheerfulness of the common people and of children. Hence the gloominess and grief - akin to a bad conscience - of the great thinkers."

A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms -- in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.
We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we have heard only of the obligation imposed by society that it should exist: to be truthful means using the customary metaphors - in moral terms, the obligation to lie according to fixed convention, to lie herd-like in a style obligatory for all..."

We're sick of being tired ~~ we all want to get wired
We just want to tweak, and stay up for a week!
The lights are always on, we are constantly awake.
We go to people's houses to see what we can take.

We scrub our carpets with a brush, our floors with a rag.
We clean our house for hours, then chase down the bag.
We're paranoid and schitze, but not afraid of Death.
Scandalous and Dishonest, but loyal to our Meth.

At times we are confused, we can't seem to understand 
What's happened to our lives, why we're outcasts of the land.
At times we act so crazy, people think we are insane
Irrational thoughts are always running through our brain.

What a high it is, for those of us who deal,
Slinging all the cutter, so we can do the real.
We come up fast ~ we make money by the scores
Everyone's our friend ~ we're surrounded by bag whores.

We all end up in prison; wondering how this hole was dug.
We blame it on society, cause we're loyal to our drug.
While in prison, we build our bodies and improve our stature
We get out on parole, and again go manufacture.

We don't care about our health; We're not worried about going back
We don't care about our lives, cause we're loyal to the sack.
So here I sit in prison, unable to get high
I take it like a man, it's no time to cry.

Soon I'll be back out, and tempted by the Meth
I'll have to be much stronger, or be loyal till my Death.

"Each one of us is alone in the world. He is shut in a tower of brass, and can communicate with his fellows only by signs, and the signs have no common value, so that their sense is vague and uncertain. We seek pitifully to convey to others the treasures of our heart, but they have not the power to accept them, and so we go lonely, side by side but not together, unable to know our fellows and unknown by them. We are like people living in a country whose language they know so little that, with all manner of beautiful and profound things to say, they are condemned to the banalities of the conversation manual. Their brain is seething with ideas, and they can only tell you that the umbrella of the gardener's aunt is in the house."

Gemstone:
You put on a ruby pierced-heart pin.
s>touch my pin

As you touch the pin, your mind is filled with the image of an innocent-looking young man dressed in a simple white silk robe.  His delicate features are hidden in shadow and in his hands he holds a ruby red heart.  He takes a step forward and his face comes into clear view.  His lips curl in cruel satisfaction as keening laments and cries of pain seem to rise around him.  The heart in his hands, so perfect just a moment ago, now lies twisted in his grasp and a slender silver dagger pierces it through.

As the vision fades, the voices in your mind begin to still and then fall quiet.

"I think your courage failed. The weakness of your body communicated itself to your soul. I do not know what infinite yearning possesses you, so that you are driven to a perilous, lonely search for some goal where you expect to find a final release from the spirit that torments you. I see you as the eternal pilgrim to some shrine that perhaps does not exist. I do not know to what inscrutable Nirvana you aim. Do you know yourself? Perhaps it is Truth and Freedom that you seek, and for a moment you thought that you might find release in Love. I think your tired soul sought rest in a woman's arms, and when you found no rest there you hated her. You had no pity for her, because you have no pity for yourself. And you killed her out of fear, because you trembled still at the danger you had barely escaped."

                    And let thy gentle fingers fling

                    If in this heart a hope be dear,

                        Or else this heavy heart will burst;

[11-11-2004, Thursday, 18:11:31] GSAemergin: and I saw someone standing in our parking lot and he was waving a sword and complaining about his ping and prophesying the doom of the end of the armageddon or the world or something and I NEED SOME MORE BAWLS and I called up my boss on his cell phone and woke him up and he was mad and called me a Choad and said to lay off the caffeine and reminded me of the time I barricaded myself in the office supply closet and OH GOD MY EYES ARE MOVING INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE ANOTHER so I had another Bawls to calm down and then looked outside and saw he was in fact real and on the roof of our truck breaking windows and then he saw me and I ducked and I CAN NO LONGER FIND MY OTHER HAND smashing the glass and coming through into the building and the sword was over his head and I was running and all of my customers were on hold but how could I hope to explain and who could I turn to?
[11-11-2004, Thursday, 18:11:37] GSAemergin: MY HEART HAS CEASED BEATING WITH ANY DISCERNABLE RHYTHM and now he's tearing out the cables from the phone closet and quoting scripture I never heard of and there's no one here to help me but a phone full of angry callers and that woman we just hired in the server room who attacks anyone who comes near look at that I'VE GROWN AN EXTRA APPENDAGE CONTAINING A SINGLE ORIFICE THROUGH WHICH IT SPEAKS, HEARS, AND EATS if you are still there call the police the BUTTONS HAVE FLED THE PHONE and good God the man with the sword is heading toward the server room, AND NOW THE WOMAN IN THERE HAS GOT A DESK FAN WITH THE FINGER GUARD REMOVED SHE'S COMING RIGHT AT HIM Ohhh!

"Cause and effect: such a duality probably never exists; in truth we are confronted by a continuum out of which we isolate a couple of pieces, just as we perceive motion only as isolated points and then infer it without ever actually seeing it. The suddenness with which many effects stand out misleads us; actually, it is sudden only for us. In this moment of suddenness there are an infinite number of processes which elude us. An intellect that could see cause and effect as a continuum and a flux and not, as we do, in terms of an arbitrary division and dismemberment, would repudiate the concept of cause and effect and deny all conditionality."

Speedlore and Methology: Part I

  "Of all the separate realities, legal landscapes, and metabolic metropolis
that thrive beneath the surface of the Cleaver's USA, no subculture seems 
as pervasive or uniform as the nationwide-eyed, high dosage 
methamphetamine club.
  This group is a tribute to the idea that some things stay the same 
across time or space... the members come and go, some leave quietly, some 
go snitch, croak, or disappear, some hang in there after their lights 
have gone out, and quite a few are dragged off at 6:00 a.m. Friday 
morning by blue windbreakers with yellow writing.
  Getting in too deep is what we do, it's who we are.
  But despite all this, there are a few of us who have managed to hang 
around the periphery for decades, avoiding the felonies, gunshots, big 
ripoffs, and crippling motorcycle accidents. Other than luck, the key to 
staying alive is knowing when to take a step back, on your own, and avoid 
the biggest bear-trap in the speed circus: taking yourself too 
seriously...
  Truly not giving a fuck is the only way to maintain perspective. In 
other words, there are worse things that can happen, than having to lay 
down and go to sleep for a week... no drug or state of mind is worth 
dying for, killing for, or doing hard time for..." (Speed Phreak)




"The Crow and the Fox

At the top of a tree perched Master Crow;
In his beak he was holding a cheese.
Drawn by the smell, Master Fox spoke, below.
The words, more or less, were these:
"Hey, now, Sir Crow! Good day, good day!
How very handsome you do look, how grandly distingu�
No lie, if those songs you sing
Match the plumage of your wing,
You�re the phoenix of these woods, our choice."
Hearing this, the Crow was all rapture and wonder.
To show off his handsome voice,
He opened beak wide and let go of his plunder.
The Fox snapped it up and then said, "My Good Sir,
Learn that each flatterer
Lives at the cost of those who heed.
This lesson is well worth the cheese, indeed."
The Crow, ashamed and sick,
Swore, a bit late, not to fall again for that trick."  -  Jean de La Fontaine (translation)




"Cynic" by Adam Niswander
" If just one of my wishes or dreams would come true  I'd ask for a window commanding a view  Of all of my fellows; the whole human race  And I'd sit in my chair by the fireplace With a book and a drink and a cigarette  Forgetting my troubles and every regret  I'd stare out that window and draw a deep breath  And quietly laugh myself to death."

He did not yet see the role which such things served in the complex tapestry of life. What if some folks required lies, as the price for mental security? Should they be nonetheless denied their comforts, robbed of their illusions? Is their happiness worth less than that of others? Is it not better to tell them, if they are capable of no more, that the illusions are reality, that the lies are truth? If many desired such things, and cried out for them, is it any wonder that fellows would be found, perhaps even from noble motives, to sell them such wares, keeping the truth to themselves, as their burden and secret?"

"The reason ... so-called mediums are unethical and dangerous is that they are not helping anyone in what they are doing. They are simply preying on the emotions of grieving people. As all loss, death, and grief counselors know, the best way to deal with death is to face it head on. Death is a part of life, and pretending that the dead are gathering in a television studio in New York to talk twaddle with a former ballroom-dance instructor is an insult to the intelligence and humanity of the living.

"He that outlives a wife whom he has long loved, sees himself disjoined from the only mind that has the same hopes, and fears, and interest; from the only companion with whom he has shared much good and evil; and with whom he could set his mind at liberty, to retrace the past or anticipate the future. The continuity of being is lacerated; the settled course of sentiment and action is stopped; and life stands suspended and motionless."

"We would surely be missing something important about our own nature if we refused to face up to the fact that hallucinations are part of being human. However, none of this makes hallucinations part of an external rather than an internal reality. Five to ten percent of us are extremely suggestible, able to move at a command into a deep hypnotic trance. Roughly ten percent of Americans report having seen one or more ghosts. This is more than the number who allegedly remember being abducted by aliens, about the same as the number who've reported seeing one or more UFO's, and less than the number who in the last week of Richard Nixon's Presidency - before he resigned to avoid impeachment - thought he was doing a good-to-excellent job as President."

'the lesson of the moth'

i was talking to a moth
the other evening
he was trying to break into
an electric light bulb
and fry himself on the wires

why do you fellows
pull this stunt i asked him
because it is the conventional
thing for moths or why
if that had been an uncovered
candle instead of an electric
light bulb you would
now be a small unsightly cinder
have you no sense

plenty of it he answered
but at times we get tired
of using it
we get bored with the routine
and crave beauty
and excitement
fire is beautiful
and we know that if we get
too close it will kill us
but what does that matter
it is better to be happy
for a moment
and be burned up with beauty
than to live a long time
and be bored all the while
so we wad all our life up
into one little roll
and then we shoot the roll
that is what life is for
it is better to be a part of beauty
for one instant and then cease to
exist than to exist forever
and never be a part of beauty
our attitude toward life
is come easy go easy
we are like human beings
used to be before they became
too civilized to enjoy themselves

and before i could argue him
out of his philosophy
he went and immolated himself
on a patent cigar lighter
i do not agree with him
myself i would rather have
half the happiness and twice
the longevity

but at the same time i wish
there was something i wanted
as badly as he wanted to fry himself

Sonnet: Love Is Not All 

"Love is not all: It is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain,
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
and rise and sink and rise and sink again.
Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;
Yet many a man is making friends with death
even as I speak, for lack of love alone.
It well may be that in a difficult hour,
pinned down by need and moaning for release
or nagged by want past resolution's power,
I might be driven to sell your love for peace,
Or trade the memory of this night for food.
It may well be. I do not think I would."

The More Loving One 

Looking up at the stars, I know quite well
That, for all they care, I can go to hell,
But on earth indifference is the least
We have to dread from man or beast.

How should we like it were stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return?
If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.

Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn,
I cannot, now I see them, say
I missed one terribly all day.

Were all stars to disappear or die,
I should learn to look at an empty sky
And feel its total dark sublime,
Though this might take me a little time.

     -- W. H. Auden




Lay your sleeping head, my love 

Lay your sleeping head, my love,
Human on my faithless arm;
Time and fevers burn away
Individual beauty from
Thoughtful children, and the grave
Proves the child ephemeral:
But in my arms till break of day
Let the living creature lie,
Mortal, guilty, but to me
The entirely beautiful.

Soul and body have no bounds:
To lovers as they lie upon
Her tolerant enchanted slope
In their ordinary swoon,
Grave the vision Venus sends
Of supernatural sympathy,
Universal love and hope;
While an abstract insight wakes
Among the glaciers and the rocks
The hermit's sensual ecstasy.

Certainty, fidelity
On the stroke of midnight pass
Like vibrations of a bell,
And fashionable madmen raise
Their pedantic boring cry:
Every farthing of the cost,
All the dreaded cards foretell,
Shall be paid, but from this night
Not a whisper, not a thought,
Not a kiss nor look be lost.

Beauty, midnight, vision dies:
Let the winds of dawn that blow
Softly round your dreaming head
Such a day of sweetness show
Eye and knocking heart may bless,
Find the mortal world enough;
Noons of dryness see you fed
By the involuntary powers,
Nights of insult let you pass
Watched by every human love.

	-- W. H. Auden

"Crystal Meth. Finally, here's an issue we can sink our teeth into. Well what can I say, it quite simply is one of the most difficult, if not THE most difficult, struggle I've ever dealt with. Let me share how it is for me, being high. First of all, it numbs my feelings. I feel no pain or regret when I'm high. No sense of duty to anyone but myself, it's a selfish drug, no doubt there. Second, the sexual euphoria can be downright overpowering. Crystal goes straight to my dick. If my crystal-induced promiscuity has ever hurt you, I apologize sincerley, but it wasn't about you or me or us, it was about crystal meth grabbing my cock at the base like a vice grip with a velvet glove, pulling me out the door and into some of the most outlandish sexual encounters I could ever imagine. 

Cigarette, anyone? Gee, does it sound like I'm glamorizing crystal meth? Now let me share with you how it is for me, coming down. 

Pain, physical pain, stemming from a malnurished body, sores all over your face, fingers raw from picking and biting, dick raw from hours of repeated masturbation, maybe your ass hurting from some overzealous motherfucker, headaches and backaches from sitting in the same position at your computer all night long. Disgust, at yourself for what you've given up to be what you now are. Sheer, unrelenting anguish for being the biggest loser on earth, right up there with the others. Despair. Anxiety and paranoia and fear. But the worst by far, is that need to get high once again. It's not a desire to get high for recreational purposes, no no no. It's a need to get high so you can simply feel like a functional human being. Because no human being, not even a dog, should feel as down as you feel at that moment."

head, so that one side of his head fell on one shoulder and the other
side upon the other shoulder."  The defendant was acquitted by
instruction of the court, the learned judges holding that the words did
not charge murder, for they did not affirm the death of the cook, that
being only an inference.

pictures.  One day, without knowing it, he photographs a top-secret
military installation.  In an instant, armed troops surround Murray and
Esther and hustle them off to prison.
        They can't prove who they are because they've left their
passports in their hotel room.  For three weeks they're tortured day
and night to get them to name their contacts in the liberation
movement..  Finally they're hauled in front of a military court,
charged with espionage, and sentenced to death.
        The next morning they're lined up in front of the wall where
they'll be shot.  The sergeant in charge of the firing squad asks them
if they have any lasts requests.  Esther wants to know if she can call
her daughter in Chicago.  The sergeant says he's sorry, that's not
possible, and turns to Murray.
        "This is crazy!"  Murray shouts.  "We're not spies!"  And he
spits in the sergeants face.
        "Murray!"  Esther cries.  "Please!  Don't make trouble."

"We have gone on piling weapon upon weapon, missile upon missile, new
levels of destructiveness upon old ones.  We have done this helplessly,
almost involuntarily: like the victims of some sort of hypnotism, like
men in a dream, like lemmings heading for the sea, like the children of
Hamelin marching blindly along behind their Pied Piper.  And the result
is that today we have achieved, we and the Russians together, in the
creation of these devices and their means of delivery, levels of
redundancy of such grotesque dimensions as to defy rational understanding."

Hack placidly amidst the noisy printers and remember what prizes there
may be in Science.  As fast as possible get a good terminal on a good system.
Enter your data clearly but always encrypt your results.  And listen to others,
even the dull and ignorant, for they may be your customers.  Avoid loud and
aggressive persons, for they are sales reps.
        If you compare your outputs with those of others, you may be surprised,
for always there will be greater and lesser numbers than you have crunched.
Keep others interested in your career, and try not to fumble; it can be a real
hassle and could change your fortunes in time.
        Exercise system control in your experiments, for the world is full of
bugs.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive
for linearity and everywhere papers are full of approximations.  Strive for
proportionality.  Especially, do not faint when it occurs.  Neither be cyclical
about results; for in the face of all data analysis it is sure to be noticed.
        Take with a grain of salt the anomalous data points.  Gracefully pass
them on to the youth at the next desk.  Nurture some mutual funds to shield
you in times of sudden layoffs.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings
-- the real bugs are enough to screw you badly.  Murphy's Law runs the
Universe -- and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt <Curl>B*n dS = 0.
        Therefore, grab for a piece of the pie, with whatever proposals you
can conceive of to try.  With all the crashed disks, skewed data, and broken
line printers, you can still have a beautiful secretary.  Be linear.  Strive
to stay employed.

What is good?  Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the
will to power, power itself.  What is bad?  Everything that is born of
weakness.  Not contentedness but more power; not peace but war; not virtue
but fitness.  The weak and the failures shall perish: first principle of
our love of man.  And they shall even be given every possible assistance.
What is more harmful than any vice?  Active pity for all the failures and
all the weak: Christianity.

Acquaintance, n:

Are your glasses mended with a strip of masking tape right over your nose?
Do you put pennies in the slots in your penny loafers?

Do you think pizza before noon is unhealthy?
Do you use the "greasy kid's stuff" to stick down your cowlick?
Do you wear a "nerd-pack" in your shirt pocket to keep the dozen
        or so pencils from marking the cloth?
Do you think Mary Jane is somebody's name?
Is illegal fishing is something only a daring criminal would do?
Is Batman your hero?  Superman?  Green Lantern?  The Shadow?
Do you think girls who kiss on the first date are loose?

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels:
 Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For
some reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a
toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore,
the non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or
a dozen other items that he may have "lost".  After all, any man who can
hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds,
win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be
reckoned with."

Lobster:
        Everyone loves these delectable crustaceans, but many cooks are
squeamish about placing them into boiling water alive, which is the
only proper method of preparing them.  Frankly, the easiest way to
eliminate your guilt is to establish theirs by putting them on trial
before they're cooked.  The fact is, lobsters are among the most
ferocious predators on the sea floor, and you're helping reduce crime
in the reefs.  Grasp the lobster behind the head, look it right in its
unmistakably guilty eyestalks and say, "Where were you on the night of
the 21st?", then flourish a picture of a scallop or a sole and shout,
"Perhaps this will refresh that crude neural apparatus you call a
memory!"  The lobster will squirm noticeably.  It may even take a swipe
at you with one of its claws.  Incorrigible.  Pop it into the pot.
Justice has been served, and shortly you and your friends will be,
too.

        THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17: SARTRE

Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely
unstructured language.  Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just
are.  Thus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions.
SARTRE programmers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at
parties.

Cecil, you're my final hope
Of finding out the true Straight Dope
For I have been reading of Schrodinger's cat
But none of my cats are at all like that.
This unusual animal (so it is said)
Is simultaneously alive and dead!
What I don't understand is just why he
Can't be one or the other, unquestionably.
My future now hangs in between eigenstates.
In one I'm enlightened, in the other I ain't.
If *you* understand, Cecil, then show me the way
And rescue my psyche from quantum decay.
But if this queer thing has perplexed even you,
Then I will *and* I won't see you in Schrodinger's zoo.
