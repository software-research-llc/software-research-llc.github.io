SRLLC offers a chatbot compatible with cellular text messages.  To use it, just send a text to **(315) 757-4475**.

- The service is free: monetization is not a concern with others (e.g. WhatsApp) offering comparable functionality as part of their systems.
- We obviously disclaim any liability for any actions taken based on the generated content, or taking generated content too seriously. Please be aware it may not reflect our positions, practices, or beliefs.
- The service also supports generating images using a diffuser model, and sending the result back via MMS.
- The large language model powering the chatbot is static (i.e. does not use current web search results), and was designed to give authoritative answers.
- Uptime is not guaranteed, and it may go down for days at a time without warning. When the service is actively responding to incoming messages, they'll be generated and sent in less than 60 seconds.
