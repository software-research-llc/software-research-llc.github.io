<big>SRLLC has a program responding to SMS messages (mobile text messages). It can chat, offer advice on how to make low calorie meals, discuss our company with you, draw pictures for you (e.g. "an astronaut riding a horse on the moon"), or even write your romantic partner a "dear john" (breakup) letter. It's available at (315) 757-4475 free of charge.

<p><h3>Note: if you are not considered an adult in your geographic region, please <i>do not</i> use our service (or, should you do so anyway, you agree to indemnify us against any and all liability for your fraudulently representing yourself as something that you are not).</h3></p>


<u>Miscellanea:</u>
- We disclaim any liability for any actions taken based on the generated content, or taking generated content too seriously. Also, be aware that it may not always reflect our positions, practices, or beliefs.
- Uptime is not guaranteed, and it may go down for days at a time without warning. When the service is actively responding to incoming messages, they'll be generated and sent in less than 60 seconds. When it's down, any messages that were received while it's down will be responded to when it comes back up.
- We keep logs of the messages received, messages sent, and what number(s) messages came from or went to; any other records under our control pertaining to messages are deleted.
- While we do no filtering whatsoever based on message content, the mobile providers that we are registered with do. Be aware of it: it's beyond our control.
- Sending nothing but a ? (a single character question mark) will offer some usage information.
