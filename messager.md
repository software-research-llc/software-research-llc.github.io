SRLLC offers a chatbot compatible with cellular text messages.  To use it, just send a text to **(315) 757-4475**.

- The service is free: monetization is not a concern with others (e.g. WhatsApp) offering comparable functionality as part of their systems.
- We obviously disclaim any liability for any actions taken based on the generated content, or taking generated content too seriously. Please be aware it may not reflect our positions, practices, or beliefs.
- The service also supports generating images using a diffuser model, and sending the result back via MMS.
- The large language model powering the chatbot is static (i.e. does not use current web search results), and was designed to give authoritative answers.
- Uptime is not guaranteed, and it may go down for days at a time without warning. When the service is actively responding to incoming messages, they'll be generated and sent in less than 60 seconds. When it's down, any messages that were received while it's down will be responded to when it comes back up.
- Yes, we keep logs of the messages received, messages sent, and what number(s) messages came from or went to. We delete any other records, and in our experience, it takes a literal court order to pry enterprise records out of someone (even if you have a justifiable need for them). Please feel free to discuss whatever you wish with our "Oracle," but be aware that the mobile providers take it upon themselves to block lascivious activity; we are registered with them and use their services, and as such, are subject to their rules. No skin off our noses, either way -- but as we said, we disclaim any and all liability for how you use whatever information you wish to receive from our program.
